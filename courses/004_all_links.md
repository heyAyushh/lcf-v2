## main

See, all your learning material is here. But there are other things. We have podcasts. We have jobChallenge. We have a lot of Internet property which can aid your learning. I would suggest that you give a look at it from time to time. Don't get overwhelmed. Even if you're on few platforms and do the course you'll get the full benefit of the course. But if you're everywhere you'll get much more motivated.

## podcasts

I feel that podcasts are essential to productivity. You can learn even when you don't feel like coding, or watching a video. Going for a walk? Doing some household chores? Why not tune in to one of the episodes.

Below are the podcasts in the order of importance for a beginner to intermediate to advanced.

## social media handles

I am quite active on Social Media. Sometimes, I do share the same status across but mostly I try to keep different profiles. Depending on where you're in your developer journey, I would urge you to follow that place. Or, you know, follow all.

### instagram

Most of the students are here. You get daily updates about courses, videos etc. here. You can call this the official channel of learncodingfree.org. We are here because you are here. Instagram is the most used social media app for the demography this course aims to serve.

### twitter

Twitter's for community and peers.
I am an active member of the JavaScript community. Many times I give talks in conferences and meetups. Twitter is the place where I interact with most of the community leaders and members. You won't get a lot of beginner content here. Mostly intermediate and advanced stuff.
