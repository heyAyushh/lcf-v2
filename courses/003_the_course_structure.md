## thought

This course is for folks who have zero idea about coding. They can get a browser (preferably Chrome), install something like VSCode and get started. All you need to do is type what you see. After the first project, your confidence will increase.

## how to go about

If you're an absolute beginner, start from the first thing on the sidebar and then go one by one. The order is done in a way where the first course is a pre-requisite for the second course.
