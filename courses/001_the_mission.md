## the journey

Anyone and everyone is driven by a mission. I have one too, and it gives me purpose and energy to be driven every day. When I started this journey, I had 100 students. From there we grew onto 1000, 10,000 and now 20,000+. Over the last year we have grown tremendously. However, this is not it.

## the site revamp

The site which you're seeing right now was not there. The structure wasn't there. Then when I sat one day and thought about what next, I got an answer: Help more people. What I was able to do in around 12 months was remarkable. It meant that the course, the mentorship, the personal touch resonates with students. So, why can't I do it for more people? And that's when I decided to go bigger and came with a clear, concise mission for the year 2020-21.

> **Get 50,000 students across the globe to start coding and host their first project.**

## experience till now

What I have figured out over my years of experience was that people have trouble getting their first few wins. Hosting their first website, writing their first program. If you have hosted 5 projects, you're much less likely to give up on programming. However, the first few wins are tough to get. And that's where I am going to spend my entire energy.

## the community

Together my students and I have created an amazing community. You can get started with the courses below and join the community. You can interact with each other, make friends. But most importantly, as a beginner, you can get help! If you're stuck, my students, and God bless them for that! will help you out and make sure you get out of the jam.

## what next

If you're a beginner, it would be great if you know who I am a little bit. Knowing me might help you in going through the course. Familiarity makes a tough journey simple.
